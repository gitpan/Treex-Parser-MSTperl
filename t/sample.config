# algorithm variant to use for the labeller training and labelling
# (especially regarding the emission probabilities used in the Viterbi algorithm)
# some of them still TODO
# 0 MIRA-trained weights recomputed by +abs(min) and converted to probs (no MLE)
# 1 dtto, NOT converted to probs (should be same as 0)
# 2 dtto, sum in Viterbi instead of product (new_prob = old_prob + emiss*trans)
# 3 dtto, no recompution (just strip <= 0)
# 4 basic MLE (no MIRA, no smoothing, uniform feature weights,
#   blind (unigram) transition backoff,
#   blind emission backoff (but should not be necessary))
# 5 full Viterbi (dtto, transition probs lambda smoothing by EM)
# 6 approx the correct way hopefully (full Viterbi + MIRA weighting of features,
#   init weights with 100, update with $error,
#   not really probs but prob-like scores)
# 7 the same with fixed best state selection in viterbi
# 8 completely new, based on reading, no MLE, MIRA for all,
#   same features for label unigrams and label bigrams
# 9 TODO dtto, initialize emissions and transitions by MLE

# Lowercase names of fields in the input file (separated by tab in the file).
# Use [a-z0-9_] only, using always at least one letter.
# Use unique names, i.e. devise some names even for unused fields.
#
# Treex represents the names as names of attributes of nodes,
# with several special values:
# - parent_ord = ord of the node's parent node
# - coarse_tag = coarse grained tag
# - aligned_* (eg. aligned_pos) = the field on aligned node
# - dummy_* (eg. dummy_1, dummy_2) = ignored field

# Using cache should be turned on (1) if training with a real lot of RAM or on small

# Features to be computed on data.
#
# Use lowercase field names (eg. pos) for fields of (child) nodes
# and uppercase field names (eg. POS) for parent nodes,
# joined together by the | sign (eg. POS|LEMMA).
#
# If you do not care for the parent-child role but are interested more in the
# nodes position, use 1.field_name for the field of the two of the nodes
# which appears first in the sentence (i.e. it has lower ord)
# and 2.field_name for the second one (eg. 1.pos for pos of first of the nodes).
#
# There are also several predefined functions that you can make use of:
#   distance(ord_field) - bucketed ord-wise distance of child and parent (ORD minus ord)
#   preceding(field) - value of the specified field on the ord-wise preceding node
#   (use PRECEDING(field) to get field on node preceding the PARENT)
#   following(field) - the same for ord-wise following node
#   between(field) - value of the specified field for each node which is
#       ord-wise between the child node and the parent node
#   equals(field1,field2) - returns 1 if the value of field1 is the same as
#       the value of field2; for fields with multiple values (eg. with
#       aligned nodes), it has the meaning of an "exists" operator: it returns
#       1 if there is at least one pair of values of each field that are
#       the same.
#       returns 0 if no values match, -1 if (at least) one of the fields is
#       undef (may be also represented by an empty string)
#   equalspc(field1,field2) - like equals but first field is taken from parent
#       and second from child ("pc" stands for "parent child")
#   equalspcat(field,index) - "equals parent-child at"; takes the index-th
#       character (0-based indexing) of the given field on parent and on child,
#       returns 1 if they are equal, 0 if they differ, -1 if uncomparable
#       (at least one of the fields is not long enough)
#       Designed to be used to ensure eg. grammatical agreement in gender,
#       number and case (adjective - noun, subject - predicate etc.)
#   isfirst(ord) - is the node with this ord first in the sentence? (1/0)
#   islast(ord) - is the node with this ord last in the sentence? (1/0)
# The parameter of a function must be a (child) field name or an integer
# (as the index in equalspcat).
