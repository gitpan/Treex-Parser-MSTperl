=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Sentence

=head1 VERSION

version 0.11949

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a sentence, both parsed an unparsed.
Contains an array of nodes which represent the words in the sentence.

The nodes are ordered, their C<ord> is their 1-based position in the sentence.
The C<0 ord> value is reserved for the (technical) sentence root.

=head1 FIELDS

=over 4

=item id (Int)

An integer id unique for each sentence (in its proper sense, where sentence
is a sequence of tokens - i.e. C<id> stays the same for copies of the same
sentence).

=item nodes (ArrayRef[Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Node])

(A reference to) an array of nodes (C<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Node>) of
the sentence.

A node represents both a token of the sentence (usually this is a word) and a
node in the parse tree of the sentence as well (if the sentence have been
parsed).

=item nodes_with_root (ArrayRef[Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Node])

Copy of C<nodes> field with a root node
(L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::RootNode>) added at the beginning. As the
root node's C<ord> is C<0> by definition, the position of the nodes in this
array exactly corresponds to its C<ord>.

=item edges (Maybe[ArrayRef[Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Edge]])

If the sentence is parsed (i.e. the nodes know their parents), this field
contains (a reference to) an array of all edges
(L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Edge>) in the parse tree of the sentence.

This field is set by the C<sub> C<fill_fields_after_parse>.

If the sentence is not parsed, this field is C<undef>.

=item features (Maybe[ArrayRef[Str]])

If the sentence is parsed, this field
contains (a reference to) an array of all features of all edges in the parse
tree of the sentence. If some of the features are repeated in the sentence
(i.e. they are present in severeal edges or even repeated in one edge), they
are repeated here as well, i.e. this is not a set in mathematical sense but a
(generally unordered) list.

This field is set by the C<sub> C<fill_fields_after_parse>.

If the sentence is not parsed, this field is C<undef>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item my $sentence = Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Sentence->new(
    id => 12, nodes => [$node1, $node2, $node3, ...]);

Creates a new sentence. The C<id> must be unique (but copies of the same
sentence are to share the same id). It is used for edge signature generation
(L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Edge/signature>) in edge features caching (and
therefore does not have to be set if caching is disabled).

The order of the nodes denotes their order in the sentence, starting from the
node with C<ord> 1, i.e. the technical root
(L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::RootNode>) is not to be included as it is
generated automatically in the constructor.
The C<ord>s of the nodes (L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Node/ord>) do not
have to (and actually shouldn't) be filled in. If they are, they are checked
and a warning on STDERR is issued if they do not correspond to the position of
the nodes in the array. If they are not, they are filled in automatically
during the sentence creation.

Other fields (C<nodes_with_root>, C<edges> and C<features>) should usually not
be set. C<nodes_with_root> are set automatically during sentence creation (and
any value set to it is discarded). C<edges> and C<features> are to be set only
if the sentence is parsed (i.e. the nodes know their parents, see
L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Node/parent> and
L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Node/parentOrd>) by calling the
C<fill_fields_after_parse> method.

So, if the sentence is already parsed, you should call the
C<fill_fields_after_parse> method immediately after creaion of the sentence.

=item my $unparsed_sentence_copy = $sentence->copy_nonparsed();

Creates a new instance of the same sentence with the same C<id> and with
copies of the nodes but without any parsing information (like after calling
C<clear_parse>). The nodes are copied by calling
L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Node/copy_nonparsed>.

=back

=head2 Action methods

=over 4

=item $sentence->setChildParent(5, 3)

Sets the parent of the node with the first C<ord> to be the node with the second
C<ord> - eg. here, the 3rd node is the parent of the 5th node.
It only sets the C<parent> and C<parentOrd> fields in the child node
(i.e. it does not create or modify any edges).

When all nodes' parents have been set, C<fill_fields_after_parse> can be called.

=item $sentence->fill_fields_after_parse()

Fills the fields of the sentence and fields of its nodes which can be filled
only for a sentence that has already been parsed (i.e. if the nodes' C<parent>
or C<parentOrd> fields are filled).

The fields which are filled by this subroutine are C<edges> and C<features>
for the sentence and C<parent> or C<parentOrd> for each of the sentence nodes
which do not have the field set.

=item $sentence->clear_parse()

Is kind of an inversion of the C<fill_fields_after_parse> method. It clears
the C<edges> and C<features> fields and also unsets the parents of all nodes
(by setting their C<parent> field to C<undef> and C<parentOrd> to C<0>).

=back

=head2 Information methods

=over 4

=item $sentence->len()

Returns length of the sentence, i.e. number of nodes in the sentence.
Each node corresponds to one word (one token to be more precise).

=item $sentence->count_errors_attachement($correct_sentence)

Compares the parse tree of the sentence with its correct parse tree,
represented by an instance of the same sentence containing its correct parse.

An error is considered to be an incorrectly assigned governing node. So, the
parents of all nodes (obviously not including the root node) are compared and
if they are different, it is counted as an error. This leads to a minimum
number of errors equal to 0 and maximum number equal to the length of the
sentence.

=item $sentence->count_errors_labelling($correct_sentence)

Compares the labelling of the sentence with its correct labelling,
represented by an instance of the same sentence containing the correct labels.

An error is considered to be an incorrectly assigned label. So, the
labels of all edges (technically stored in the child nodes) are compared and
if they are different, it is counted as an error. This leads to a minimum
number of errors equal to 0 and maximum number equal to the length of the
sentence.

=item $sentence->getNodeByOrd(6)

Returns the node with this C<ord> (it can also be the root node if the C<ord>
is 0) or C<undef> if the C<ord> is out of range.

=item $sentence->toString()

Returns forms of the nodes joined by spaces (i.e. the sentence as a text but
with a space between each two adjacent tokens).

=item $sentence->toParentOrdsArray()

Returns (a reference to) an array of node parent ords, i.e. for the sentence
"Tom is big", where "is" is a child of the root node and "Tom" and "big" are
children of "is", this method returns C<[2, 0, 2]>.
