=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::TrainerUnlabelled

=head1 VERSION

version 0.11306

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Trains on correctly parsed sentences and so creates and tunes the model.
Uses single-best MIRA (McDonald et al., 2005, Proc. HLT/EMNLP)

=head1 FIELDS

=over 4

=item parser

Reference to an instance of L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Parser> which is
used for the training.

=item model

Reference to an instance of L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::ModelUnlabelled>
which is being trained.

=back

=head1 METHODS

The C<sumUpdateWeight> is a number by which the change of the feature weights
is multiplied in the sum of the weights, so that at the end of the algorithm
the sum corresponds to its formal definition, which is a sum of all weights
after each of the updates. C<sumUpdateWeight> is a member of a sequence going
from N*T to 1, where N is the number of iterations
(L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::FeaturesControl/number_of_iterations>, C<10>
by default) and T being the number of sentences in training data, N*T thus
being the number of inner iterations, i.e. how many times C<mira_update()> is
called.

=over 4

=item $trainer->train($training_data);

Trains the model, using the settings from C<config> and the training
data in the form of a reference to an array of parsed sentences
(L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Sentence>), which can be obtained by the
L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Reader>.

=item $self->mira_update($sentence_correct_parse, $sentence_best_parse,
    $sumUpdateWeight)

Performs one update of the MIRA (Margin-Infused Relaxed Algorithm) on one
sentence from the training data. Its input is the correct parse of the sentence
(from the training data) and the best scoring parse created by the parser.

=item my ( $features_diff_1, $features_diff_2, $features_diff_count ) =
    features_diff( $features_1, $features_2 );

Compares features of two parses of a sentence, where the features
(C<$features_1>, C<$features_2>) are represented as a reference to
an array of strings representing the features
(the same feature might be present repeatedly, all occurencies of the same
feature are summed together).

Features that appear exactly the same times in both parses are disregarded.

The first two returned values (C<$features_diff_1>, C<$features_diff_2>)
are array references,
C<$features_diff_1> containing features that appear in the first parse
(C<$features_1>) more often than in the second parse (C<$features_2>),
and vice versa for C<$features_diff_2>.
Each feature is contained as many times as is the difference in number
of occurencies, eg. if the feature C<TAG|tag:NN|NN> appears 5 times in the
first parse and 8 times in the second parse, then C<$features_diff_2>
will contain C<'TAG|tag:NN|NN', 'TAG|tag:NN|NN', 'TAG|tag:NN|NN'>.

The third returned value (C<$features_diff_count>) is a count of features
in which the parses differ, ie.
C<$features_diff_count = scalar(@$features_diff_1) + scalar(@$features_diff_2)>.

=item update_feature_weight( $model, $feature, $update, $sumUpdateWeight )

Updates weight of C<$feature> by C<$update>
(which might be positive or negative)
and also updates the sum of updates of the feature
(which is later used for overtraining avoidance),
multiplied by C<$sumUpdateWeight>, which is simply a count of inner iterations
yet to be performed (thus eliminating the need to update the sum on each
inner iteration).
