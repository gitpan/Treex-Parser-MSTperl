=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::TrainerUnlabelled

=head1 VERSION

version 0.07298

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Trains on correctly parsed sentences and so creates and tunes the model.
Uses single-best MIRA (McDonald et al., 2005, Proc. HLT/EMNLP)

=head1 FIELDS

=over 4

=item parser

Reference to an instance of L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Parser> which is
used for the training.

=item model

Reference to an instance of L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::ModelUnlabelled>
which is being trained.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $trainer->train($training_data);

Trains the model, using the settings from C<config> and the training
data in the form of a reference to an array of parsed sentences
(L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Sentence>), which can be obtained by the
L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Reader>.

=item $self->mira_update($sentence_correct_parse, $sentence_best_parse,
    $sumUpdateWeight)

Performs one update of the MIRA (Margin-Infused Relaxed Algorithm) on one
sentence from the training data. Its input is the correct parse of the sentence
(from the training data) and the best scoring parse created by the parser.
