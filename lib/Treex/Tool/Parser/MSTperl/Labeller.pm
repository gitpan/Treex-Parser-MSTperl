=head1 NAME


=head1 VERSION

version 0.09407
Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Labeller - pure Perl implementation
of a dependency tree labeller for the MST parser

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Perl implementation of the labeller for MST Parser
which is (most probably) described in
McDonald, Ryan: Discriminative Learning And Spanning Tree Algorithms
For Dependency Parsing, 2006 (chapter 3.3.3 Two-Stage Labelling).

For a dependency parse tree - presumably, but not necessarily, obtained using
the MST parser (L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Parser>), possibly
non-projective - assigns the most probable labels to the edges of the tree,
using the given model (L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::ModelLabelling>).

Assigning labels is implemented as sequence labelling, where the sequence to
be labelled is each sequence of edges between a parent node and its children.
First-order Markov factorization is used, but because we do the labelling as a
separate second stage to the parsing, many non-local features can be used,
exploiting the knowledge of the structure of the whole tree; also we go from
to root downwards and are therefore able to use the knowledge of labels
assigned to ancestor edges (especially the edge leading to the common parent
node).

Each label is technically stored with the child node of the edge it belongs to,
 so sometimes I will talk about a node label, which actually means the label
of the edge between the node and its parent.

A variant of the Viterbi algorithm is used to find the best scoring sequence
of labels. However, instead of probabilities we use (real-valued) scores and
therefore instead of multiplication addition is used in Viterbi.

For detail on the features and training see
L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::TrainerLabelling>.


I have used several sources of information to implement it, especially:

Kevin Gimpel and Shay Cohen:

(2007)

=head1 FIELDS

=over 4

=item config

Instance of L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Config> containing settings to be
used with labeller.

Currently the settings most relevant to the Labeller are the following:

=over 8

=item VITERBI_STATES_NUM_THRESHOLD

See L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Config/VITERBI_STATES_NUM_THRESHOLD>.

=item labeller_algorithm

See L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Config/labeller_algorithm>.

=item labelledFeaturesControl

See L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Config/labelledFeaturesControl>.

=item SEQUENCE_BOUNDARY_LABEL

See L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Config/SEQUENCE_BOUNDARY_LABEL>.

=back

=item model

An instance of L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::ModelLabelling>
used to label the trees. It can be changed if needed (it is usually needed
when training the labeller).

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item my $labeller = Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Labeller->new(
config => $self->config);

Creates an instance of the labeller using the given configuration, also
initializing the model.

=item $labeller->load_model('modelfile.lmodel');

=item $labeller->load_model_tsv('modelfile.tsv');

Loads a labelled model
using L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::ModelBase/load>
or L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::ModelBase/load_tsv>.

A model has to be loaded or created in an other way
before sentences can be labelled.

=item $labeller->label_sentence($sentence);

Labels a sentence (instance of L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Sentence>). It
finds the best labels for the sentence and returns them as an array reference.

The given sentence is left intact and any labelling information already
contained in the sentence is disregarded.

=item $labeller->label_sentence_internal($sentence);

Does the actual labelling, returning a labelled instance of
L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Sentence>. The C<label_sentence> sub is
actually only a wrapper for this method which extracts the labels of the
nodes and returns these. If you are only interested in getting the labels,
use C<label_sentence>, but if it is handy for you to get a whole instance of
L<Treex::Tool::Parser::MSTperl::Sentence> (which is labelled), use
C<label_sentence_internal>. The subroutines are otherwise equivalent.

The given sentence is left intact and any labelling information already
contained in the sentence is disregarded. All other information from the
given sentence is copied to the returned sentence, the sentence only differ
in the labels assigned.

=item $labeller->label_subtree($parent);

Assign labels to edges going from the $parent node to its children
(and recurse on the children).
Directly modifies the sentence
(or more precisely: the nodes within the sentence).

=item $labeller->label_edge($edge, $states);

Used as an internal part of label_subtree
to get all probable labels for an edge $edge
i.e. make one step of the Viterbi algorithm.
The $states is a hash reference of all currently active Viterbi states.

=item $labeller->prune($states);

Prune the states (passed as a hash ref), currently does n-best pruning
with n = C<config->VITERBI_STATES_NUM_THRESHOLD>, keeping always n best scoring
states at maximum (all states if there are less than n). Is called after
each Viterbi step, i.e. at the end of each call of C<label_edge>.
Returns the new pruned states (does not modify its input).

=item $labeller->get_possible_labels($edge, $previous_label,
$previous_label_score);

Computes possible labels for an edge, using info about the emission scores,
transition scores and last state's score. (Because of the first order Markov
factorization used, the states correspond to labels assigned to the edges they
corresond to.)

=item $labeller->get_possible_labels_internal
($emission_scores, $transition_scores, $last_state_score);

Does the actual generation of possible labels for an edge, where the emission
and transition scores are already computed for this particular edge.
