Boys love girls.
John Brown loves Mary Thatcher.
John eagerly loves the sweet little Mary.
A boy loves a girl.
John loves Mary.
Counting Flowers On The Wall
I keep hearing you're concerned about my happiness.
But all that thought you're giving me is conscience I guess.
If I was walking in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none.
While you and your friends are worried about me I'm having lots of fun.
Counting flowers on the wall that don't bother me at all.
Playing solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty-one.
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo.
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do.
It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright.
Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light.
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete.
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete.
